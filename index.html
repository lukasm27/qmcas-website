            <p><b>Presidentsâ€™ Address</b><br><br>
On behalf of the entire Committee, welcome to the Queen Mary Commercial Awareness Society.<br><br>
Founded in 2014, QMCAS has since grown into one of the largest and most active societies at Queen Mary University of London. As a career-focused society, our goal is to help students from all backgrounds and disciplines, including law, STEM, and non-law, develop a strong understanding of current affairs and their impact on the legal and commercial world. We achieve this by offering our members unique opportunities to connect with leading law firms and financial institutions, including panel discussions, skills workshops, networking evenings, and competitions.<br><br>
Over the years, QMCAS has expanded its activities and reach, always guided by a commitment to accessibility and impact. This year, our focus is on strengthening that foundation through new initiatives. We are especially delighted to introduce the QMCAS Career Accelerator, which connects members directly with mentors who have secured first-year schemes, vacation schemes, and training contracts at leading US and Magic Circle law firms. Moreover, we are able to host more career and social events than ever, thanks to the generous support of our sponsors and the guest speakers who continue to share their insights with our members. Above all, QMCAS remains dedicated to supporting our members. Whether that means helping you develop your commercial awareness, connect with leading professionals, or simply find a community of like-minded peers, our focus remains the same.<br><br>
Congratulations to all incoming first-year students and a warm welcome back to returning students. To our current members, thank you for your ongoing support, and to those joining for the first time, we look forward to meeting you and sharing an exciting year ahead together.<br><br>
Yours faithfully,<br><br>
<b>Janice Wong and Matei Tasnadi<br><br>
QMCAS Co-Presidents 2025/26</b></p>
